## Overview
Build an order summary card where user will see interactive states for hover and focus on Change link and the buttons.
The margin and paddings will differ a bit on mobile and larger screens.
The card will be responsive, shrink a bit on mobile but has a max width on larger screens, the card will not grow so much that it will loose its design and readability.

## My process
1. I started with setting up the project locally, for this project I used WebStorm from Jetbrains
2. Created the html and added the content.
3. Then the css was applied starting with styling the body tag
4. Continued with the typography and then I set up the layout.
5. I then worked my way through the page by styling from top to bottom
6. The styling I based on the mobile layout
7. At the end I added media queries for styling larger screens. I find this approach for responsive webs the easiest.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
